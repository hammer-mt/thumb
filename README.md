# thumb

A simple prompt testing library for LLMs.

## Quick start

### 1. Install the library

> `pip install thumb`

### 2. Set up a test

```Python
import os
import thumb

# Set your API key: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# set up a prompt templates for the a/b test
prompt_a = "tell me a joke"
prompt_b = "tell me a family friendly joke"

# generate the responses
test = thumb.test([prompt_a, prompt_b])
```

### 3. Rate the responses

In Jupyter Notebooks a simple user interface is displayed for blind rating responses (you don't see which prompt generated the response).

Once all responses have been rated, the following performance statistics are calculated broken down by prompt template:
- `avg_score` amount of positive feedback as a percentage of all runs
- `avg_tokens`: how many tokens were used across the prompt and response

A simple report is displayed in the notebook, and the full data is saved to a CSV file `thumb/ThumbTest-{TestID}.csv`.

## Functionality

### Set up test cases

Test cases are when you want to test a prompt template with different input variables. For example, if you want to test a prompt template that includes a variable for a comedian's name, you can set up test cases for different comedians.

```Python
# set up a prompt templates for the a/b test
prompt_a = "tell me a joke in the style of {comedian}"
prompt_b = "tell me a family friendly joke in the style of {comedian}"

# set test cases with different input variables
cases = [
  {"comedian": "chris rock"}, 
  {"comedian": "ricky gervais"}, 
  {"comedian": "robin williams"}
  ]

# generate the responses
test = thumb.test([prompt_a, prompt_b], cases)
```

Every test case will be run against every prompt template, so in this example you'll get 6 runs (3 test cases x 2 prompt templates). Every test case must include a value for each variable in the prompt template.

#### Required

- **prompts**: an array of prompts (strings) to be tested

#### Optional

- **cases**: a dictionary of variables to input into each prompt template (default: `None`)
- **runs**: the number of responses to generate per prompt and test case (default: `10`)
- **models**: a list of OpenAI models you want to generate responses from (default: [`gpt-3.5-turbo`])

If you have 10 test runs with 2 prompt templates and 3 test cases, that's `10 x 2 x 3 = 60` calls to your LLM. Be careful: these can add up quickly!

Langchain tracing to [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com/) is automatically enabled if the `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY` is set as an environment variable (optional).


## About Prompt Optimization

The difference between people just playing around with ChatGPT and those using AI in production is evaluation. LLMs respond non-deterministically, and so it's important to test what results look like when scaled up across a wide range of scenarios. Without an evaluation framework you're left blindly guessing about what's working in your prompts (or not).

Serious [prompt engineers](https://www.saxifrage.xyz/post/prompt-engineering) are testing and learning which inputs lead to useful or desired outputs, reliably and at scale. This process is called [prompt optimization](https://www.saxifrage.xyz/post/prompt-optimization), and the process looks like this:

1. Metrics ‚Äì Establish how you'll measure the performance of the responses from the AI.
2. Hypothesis ‚Äì Design one or more prompts that may work, based on the latest research.
3. Testing ‚Äì Generate responses for your different prompts against multiple test cases.
4. Analysis ‚Äì Evaluate the performance of your prompts and use them to inform the next test.

Thumb testing fills the gap between large scale professional evaluation mechanisms, and blindly prompting through trial and error. If you are transitioning a prompt into a production environment, using `thumb` to test your prompt can help you catch edge cases, and get early user or team feedback on the results.
