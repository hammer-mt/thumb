""Let me tell you about Joe Biden, man. This guy's been in politics longer than I've been telling jokes â€“ and that's saying something! I mean, he's been around so long, you'd think he's got more experience than the guy who invented the wheel.

But here's the thing, Joe's got more 'oops' moments than a clumsy toddler at a pottery class. One minute, he's giving a speech, and the next, he's like, 'Wait, what office am I running for again?' I swear, he's got more slips than a banana peel factory.

But let me tell you something, Joe Biden's plans are so detailed, even his own supporters need a translator! They're like, 'Joe, we love you, but can you explain your plan in plain English? We're not all bilingual economists over here!'

And you know, Joe Biden's speeches? Man, they're like watching an episode of 'The Price is Right' with no prizes! He'll start off strong, but by the end, you're just waiting for Drew Carey to pop up and say, 'Sorry folks, we're all out of solutions today!'

""Man, Donald Trump is something else, ain't he? I mean, this dude got more hair than an entire wig shop! He's like a walking cotton candy machine, just spinning around, leaving a trail of blonde fluff everywhere he goes!

But you know what's even crazier? His tweets! This man tweets more than a bird on steroids! I mean, every morning, we wake up wondering what crazy nonsense he's gonna spew next. It's like, 'Hey Twitter, here's another 3 AM rant from the Orange Oompa Loompa!'

And let's talk about his speeches, folks. Listening to Trump speak is like watching a comedy show without a punchline. It's all about the build-up, but when it's time to deliver, it's just empty promises and wild gestures. I swear, he could sell ice to polar bears, but when it comes to delivering on those promises, it's like watching a magic trick gone wrong. 'Abracadabra, folks! I promised you jobs, but poof, they disappeared!'

But hey, we gotta give it to the man, he's got confidence! Trump's ego is so big, it's got its own zip code! He struts around like a peacock on steroids, thinking he's the greatest thing since sliced bread. And with that hair, he might be the only one who can pull off the 'comb-over, meet the comb-forward' look!

So, love him or hate him, one thing's for sure, Donald Trump keeps us entertained. He's like the reality TV star we never asked for, but can't stop watching. And in the end, all we can do is sit back, grab some popcorn, and enjoy the show!""",397,22,375,0.0007830000000000001,6.731040000915527,0
